There are two ways to make a form disappear from the screen. One way is to Hide the form and the other is 
to Close the form. When a form is hidden, the form and all its properties and settings still exist in memory. 
In other words, the form still exists, it is just not visible. When a form is closed, the form is physically 
deleted from memory and will need to be completely recreated before it can be displayed again.

--how disable resizing and fix side
Change the FormBorderStyle to one of the Fixed values: FixedSingle, Fixed3D, FixedDialog or FixedToolWindow.
// Define the border style of the form to a dialog box.
form1.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.FixedDialog;
// Set the MaximizeBox to false to remove the maximize box.
form1.MaximizeBox = false;
// Set the start position of the form to the center of the screen.
form1.StartPosition = FormStartPosition.CenterScreen;

--The use of @ when it comes to file paths and string literals
In a string literal prefixed with @ the escape sequences starting with \ are disabled.
This is convenient for filepaths since \ is the path separator and you don't want it to 
start an escape sequence.

In a normal string you would have to escape \ into \\ so your example would look like this "pdf\\". 
But since it's prefixed with @ the only character that needs escaping is " (which is escaped as "") 
and the \ can simply appear
